This project aims to create a machine learning-driven user interface for the annotation of very large
pathology images. Each image may be 10s of thousands by 10s of thousands of pixels. As a result,
annotation of the entire slide for object recognition or semantic/instance segmentation can be time
consuming when entities are only a few pixels in diameter. This project aims to build a framework for
maximally leveraging expert annotator (clinician) time by interleaving annotation (label generation) with
inference to provide an intuitive notion of model fit and the minimal amount of labeling required for
acceptable model performance.
